Site structure
-The main page:
- A selection of the best photos displayed as a slider or gallery.
- A short text "About me" containing information about me.
- Portfolio tab:
- A photo gallery divided into the following sections:
- Personal (Personal photo sessions)
- Love story (Couples photo shoots)
- Wedding (Wedding photo shoots)
- Fashion (Fashion shooting)
*important - to begin with, you can make only the "Personal data" section visible to the visitor,
since I do not have such an extensive portfolio yet, it is important to me that in
the future these sections can be added/deleted, replenished and updated
- The "Services" tab:
- A list of services, with a detailed description of the conditions and cost of each service.
The sections are similar to the sections in the portfolio. (Service packages can be presented on
the page in the form of rectangular blocks - at the top of each block, for example, this wedding
, there will be a photo representing this block, and at the bottom there will be points
the description of the service is indicated: -the duration of the shooting, -the number of photos in processing, cost,
additional nuances that are included in this package, etc.)
All these blocks with a description of services are staggered one after another on
the page of the "Services" tab - the background of the page is different
- Contacts tab:
- Feedback form.
- Contact information (phone, e-mail)
